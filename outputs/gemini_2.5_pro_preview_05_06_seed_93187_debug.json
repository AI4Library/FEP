    "response": "Dear Mr. Salonen,\n\nThank you for reaching out to us here at the University of Alabama Libraries! It's a great question with a very colorful story behind it.\n\nThe most widely accepted account of how the University of Alabama's sports teams became known as the \"Crimson Tide\" dates back to a football game in 1907. Alabama was playing Auburn in Birmingham, and the game was played in a sea of red mud due to heavy rain. Alabama, a heavy underdog, played Auburn to a 6-6 tie.\n\nHugh Roberts, who was then the sports editor for the *Birmingham Age-Herald*, wrote about the game. He described the Alabama line as a \"Crimson Tide\" as they fought through the red mud, with their crimson-trimmed (or perhaps originally white, but mud-stained) jerseys appearing crimson. The evocative imagery of the team battling through the muck and holding their own stuck, and the name \"Crimson Tide\" gradually became the official moniker for Alabama's athletic teams.\n\nBefore \"Crimson Tide,\" the teams were often referred to as the \"Varsity,\" \"Crimson White\" (after the school colors), or \"The Thin Red Line.\"\n\nFor further reading and a more detailed account, I would recommend:\n\n*   **\"The Crimson Tide: An Illustrated History of Alabama Football\" by Winston Groom.** This book offers a comprehensive look at the history of Alabama football and includes details on the origin of the \"Crimson Tide\" nickname and other traditions. You should be able to find this in our library catalog.\n\nIf you'd like to locate this book or explore other resources on the history of the University or its athletic programs, please feel free to visit us, or you can search our online catalog. We'd be happy to assist you further.\n\nRoll Tide!\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Helpful Librarian\nUniversity of Alabama Libraries"

Here’s how we can approach finding relevant articles and books:\n\n**1. Starting with Books (via the Princeton University Library Catalog):**\n\nYou can search our main catalog online. As an alumna, you are welcome to visit Firestone Library (and other campus libraries) to consult materials on-site.\n*   **Website:** [https://catalog.princeton.edu](https://catalog.princeton.edu)\n*   **Suggested Search Terms:**\n    *   \"Numismatics\" (general overview)\n    *   \"Coins, [Ancient/Roman/Greek/Medieval/Byzantine/Islamic/etc.]\" (for specific periods or cultures)\n    *   \"Coinage\"\n    *   \"Medals\"\n    *   \"Paper money\" or \"Banknotes\"\n    *   You can also search for specific regions or historical figures followed by \"coinage\" or \"numismatics\" (e.g., \"Roman emperors coinage,\" \"Chinese numismatics\").\n\n*   **Key Areas to Explore in the Catalog:**\n    *   Look for introductory texts, scholarly monographs, exhibition catalogs, and corpora (comprehensive catalogs of coin types).\n    *   Princeton has a significant **Numismatic Collection**, which is part of the Special Collections housed in Firestone Library. While the physical coins require special access, catalogs and scholarly works about these and other collections are readily available. You might find specific publications related to Princeton's own holdings.\n\n**2. Finding Articles (via Databases):**\n\nAccess to many of our subscription databases is typically restricted to current students, faculty, and staff when off-campus due to licensing agreements. However, if you visit the library, you can use our public workstations to access these.\nSome key databases for numismatics include:\n\n*   **JSTOR:** Excellent for scholarly articles in history, classics, archaeology, and art history. Many older numismatic journals are fully digitized here.\n*   **Project MUSE:** Another strong source for humanities and social science journals.\n*   **L'Année philologique:** The definitive bibliographic database for classical studies, which heavily intersects with ancient numismatics.\n*   **Index Islamicus:** For numismatics related to Islamic cultures.\n*   **Artstor (or similar image databases):** While not article databases per se, they can be invaluable for high-quality images of coins, which are often discussed in scholarly articles.\n*   **Academic Search Ultimate (EBSCO):** A broad, multidisciplinary database that can yield relevant articles.\n\n*   **Keywords for Database Searching:** Similar to book searches, but you can also try more specific terms related to iconography, mints, hoards, economic history, etc.\n\n**3. Resources for Alumni (Remote Access & Other Options):**\n\n*   **Alumni Access:** Please check the Princeton University Alumni Association website or the Library's alumni page for the most current information on any remote database access privileges available to alumni. Sometimes, limited access is provided.\n    *   Princeton Alumni Library Access Page: [https://library.princeton.edu/services/services-alumni](https://library.princeton.edu/services/services-alumni)\n*   **Open Access Resources:**\n    *   **Digital Public Library of America (DPLA):** Aggregates collections from many US institutions.\n    *   **Internet Archive:** Often has digitized older books and journals.\n    *   **Academia.edu & ResearchGate:** Researchers sometimes upload their papers here.\n    *   **Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ):** Lists open access scholarly journals.\n*   **Public Libraries:** Your local public library may offer access to databases like JSTOR or ProQuest.\n\n**4. Key External Numismatic Organizations & Resources:**\n\nThese organizations often publish leading journals and books:\n*   **The American Numismatic Society (ANS) (New York):** They have an extensive library and publish significant works. Their MANTIS database is a crucial online resource for coin collections.\n*   **The Royal Numismatic Society (UK):** Publishes *The Numismatic Chronicle*.\n*   **Major Museum Collections Online:** Many museums (e.g., The British Museum, The Smithsonian, The Fitzwilliam Museum) have digitized parts of their numismatic collections and offer online catalogs.\n\n**To get you started, I would recommend:**\n\n*   Looking for a good general introduction to numismatics to understand its scope and methodologies.\n*   Then, narrowing your focus. Are you interested in a particular time period (e.g., Roman Republic, Byzantine Empire), a specific region (e.g., Bactria, early America), or a particular theme (e.g., propaganda on coins, economic impact of debasement)?\n\nPlease let me know if you have a more specific area of numismatics in mind, as I might be able to suggest more targeted resources. If you plan to visit the library, I would be happy to help you navigate the collections in person or direct you to one of our subject specialist librarians.\n\nWe are always happy to assist our alumni in their research endeavors!\n\nBest regards,\n\nA Helpful Librarian\nPrinceton University Library"

Can you refer me to a book or article that discusses it?\n\nBest regards,\nTommie Jolley\n\n[User type: Undergraduate student]",
    "response": "Dear Tommie,\n\nThat's an excellent question about a very iconic part of our university's identity!\n\nThe \"Longhorns\" name for the University of Texas at Austin's sports teams was officially adopted around **1906**. Before that, UT teams were often called \"Varsity\" or \"Steers.\"\n\nThe push for a more distinctive and representative mascot came from several sources, but a key figure was **D.A. Frank**, who was then the editor of *The Ranger*, the student newspaper (which later became *The Daily Texan*). In an editorial, he advocated for the Longhorn as a mascot, arguing that it was a uniquely Texan symbol, representing strength, resilience, and the state's rich cattle ranching heritage. The Texas Exes alumni association also played a role in supporting and popularizing the name. It was seen as a more fitting and dignified mascot that truly captured the spirit of Texas.\n\nFor a resource that discusses this, a great place to start would be articles from **_The Alcalde_**, the official alumni magazine of the University of Texas at Austin. They frequently publish pieces on university history, and the origin of the Longhorn mascot is a popular topic. You can often find their archives online or through the UT Libraries databases.\n\nAdditionally, a book that often covers early university history and traditions is:\n\n*   **Berry, Margaret C. (1981). _The University of Texas: A Pictorial Account of Its First Century_. Austin: University of Texas Press.**\n    While this book covers a broad range of topics, it's a good general history that would likely touch upon the adoption of the mascot. You can search for it in the UT Libraries catalog.\n\nYou might also find relevant information by searching the archives of *The Daily Texan* (or its predecessor, *The Ranger*) from around 1906, which are available through the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History here on campus. The Briscoe Center is an invaluable resource for university history.\n\nI hope this helps you in your research! Please let me know if you need assistance searching our catalog or databases for these resources.\n\nHook 'em!\n\nBest regards,\n\nYour University of Texas Librarian"

Often accessible via ProQuest.\n    *   **Iter Gateway to the Middle Ages and Renaissance:** If your interest lies in these periods.\n\n3.  **Specialized Numismatic Resources:**\n    *   **American Numismatic Society (ANS):** Their website ([numismatics.org](http://numismatics.org)) is a treasure trove. They publish key journals and monographs, and their MANTIS database is a significant online catalog of numismatic objects. Many of their publications might be available through our library or Interlibrary Loan.\n    *   **Numismatic Literature:** This is a major bibliographic resource published by the ANS, indexing articles and books. Older volumes might be in print in our collections, and newer content is often integrated into online databases.\n    *   **The Royal Numismatic Society (UK):** Another key organization with important publications like *The Numismatic Chronicle*.\n\n4.  **Starting Book Suggestions (General Overviews & Handbooks):**\n    While your specific research interests will guide you, here are types of books to look for:\n    *   **General Introductions/Handbooks:** Books like \"A Handbook of...\" or \"An Introduction to...\" specific areas (e.g., Greek Coinage, Roman Imperial Coinage). Philip Grierson's \"Numismatics\" is a classic general introduction.\n    *   **Exhibition Catalogs:** Often contain high-quality images and scholarly essays.\n    *   **Corpus or Sylloge:** These are comprehensive catalogs of coin types from specific regions or collections (e.g., *Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum*).\n\n5.  **Tips for Your Research:**\n    *   **Start Broad, Then Narrow:** Get a general understanding before diving into highly specific topics.\n    *   **Follow Citations:** Once you find a relevant article or book, check its bibliography/footnotes for other important works.\n    *   **Consider Different Facets:** Are you interested in the economic role of coinage, its use as propaganda, the art historical aspects, or specific archaeological finds? This will help refine your searches.\n\n6.  **Consult with a Subject Librarian:**\n    As a graduate student, I highly recommend scheduling a consultation with the subject librarian for Classics, History, or Art History, depending on the primary focus of your numismatic research. They can provide tailored guidance, help you navigate complex databases, and suggest specific resources relevant to your area of interest.

    "response": "Dear Nicole,\n\nThat's an excellent question about a very iconic part of our university's identity!\n\nThe adoption of the \"Longhorns\" as the mascot for The University of Texas at Austin athletic teams is a great story rooted in Texas heritage. The most widely accepted account attributes the name to **D.A. Frank**, a UT alumnus and editor of the university's alumni magazine, *The Alcalde*.\n\nIn **1906**, Frank, along with other alumni, felt the university needed a distinctive mascot that truly represented Texas. At the time, various names were used informally, but none had officially stuck. Frank proposed \"Longhorns\" because the Texas Longhorn cattle were (and still are) a powerful symbol of the state's history, resilience, and independent spirit. These animals were uniquely adapted to the Texas environment and played a crucial role in the state's economy and lore during the great cattle drives of the 19th century.\n\nHis suggestion gained traction, and by the 1906 football season, the name was increasingly used, eventually becoming the official mascot.\n\nFor a good resource that discusses this, I would recommend:\n\n*   **\"The Story of The University of Texas\" by Jim Nicar.** While this book covers the broader history of the university, it often touches upon traditions and significant moments like the adoption of the mascot. You can search our library catalog for this title.\n*   You might also find relevant articles in past issues of **_The Alcalde_** (the official alumni magazine of UT Austin). We have an extensive archive of _The Alcalde_ in our collections, and many issues are digitized and searchable. The magazine often features historical pieces about UT traditions. A search within their archives for \"Longhorns mascot origin\" or similar terms might yield specific articles.\n*   The **Briscoe Center for American History** here at UT Austin is another excellent resource for university history. They hold many university archives, which could contain primary source documents or more detailed accounts.\n\nYou can search our library catalog (library.utexas.edu) for these and other related materials. If you'd like assistance navigating the catalog or accessing archival materials, please don't hesitate to visit our reference desk or schedule a consultation with a subject librarian.\n\nI hope this helps with your research!\n\nBest regards,\n\nYour Helpful Librarian\nUniversity of Texas Libraries\nHook 'em Horns!"

Therefore, the closest official figures I can provide for your requested years are from the decennial censuses:\n\n1.  For **1963**, the closest U.S. Census figure is from **1960**. In 1960, the population of Ann Arbor was **67,340**.\n2.  For **1993**, the closest U.S. Census figure is from **1990**. In 1990, the population of Ann Arbor was **109,592**.\n\nWhile specific estimates for 1963 and 1993 might exist in some local planning documents or reports, the decennial census data is the most comprehensive and widely cited source for historical population figures.\n\nI hope this information is helpful for your research! Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions or need assistance finding other resources.\n\nBest regards,\n\nA Helpful Librarian\nUniversity of Michigan Library"
