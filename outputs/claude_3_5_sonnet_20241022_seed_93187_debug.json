    "response": "Dear Professor Evans,\n\nThank you for your interesting question about Yale's Bulldog mascot. The bulldog has been associated with Yale athletics since the 1890s. The tradition is believed to have started because of a Yale student, Andrew Graves '92S, who was a football player and rowing athlete. He owned a bulldog named \"Handsome Dan,\" who became the first live mascot of any university in America.\n\nFor detailed information about this history, I would recommend these sources:\n\n1. \"Yale's Bulldogs: A History of Handsome Dan\" by Richard Nash (Yale Alumni Magazine, 2008)\n\n2. The book \"Yale: A History\" by Brooks Mather Kelley (Yale University Press, 1974) - particularly pages 351-352 which discuss the origin of Yale's athletic traditions.\n\n3. For a comprehensive look at college mascots including Yale's Bulldog, you might find \"Mascots: How They Came to Be\" by Steven J. Zeitlin (University Press of Mississippi, 2000) helpful.\n\nYou can find these materials in Sterling Memorial Library, and I'd be happy to help you locate them if needed.\n\nBest regards,\nYale University Librarian"
